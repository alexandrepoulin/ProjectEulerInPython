## in order for the triangle to have an area which is a multiple of 6 and 28,
## we need a*b/2 to be divisible by 2,3, and 4,7
## without redundency, we need it to be divisible by 3,4,7.
## this means that a*b needs to be divisible by 2*2*2*3*7=168
## this means there are the following possible groupings
## 1*168
## 2*84
## 3*56
## 4*42
## 6*28
## 7*24
## 8*21
## 12*14
